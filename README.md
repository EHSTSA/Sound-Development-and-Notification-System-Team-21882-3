The Problem

People that are hard of hearing often aren’t aware of several significant sound-based noises in their everyday life such as doorbells and emergency alarms. These doorbell and emergency alarm systems were created to inform everyone about the event, but they aren’t accessible for deaf people. When not with others, deaf people can easily miss these sounds, yet they are critical for awareness and safety. 

Our Solution

We have created and trained an AI model that can accurately detect when a doorbell or emergency alarm noise is detected. The AI model takes audio in real time and can even display its percentage certainty of the noise. Due to its training, the AI model remains highly effective with large amounts of background noise and in any situation the user would be in. It can detect sounds within 1-2 seconds, providing an immediate alert so users can respond.

We have also created a user friendly, interactive, website that can run in the background, feeding the AI model audio from the user’s microphone, and will notify the user whenever the AI model picks up an important noise. It will instantly send the user a notification about the noise so they can know what is going on even when they are not on the tab. It will also keep a log of events on the website with specific times, and percentage certainty of the model, so the user can remain informed with all the information. 

For the user’s privacy, the website doesn’t store any of the audio it records. If the user is in an environment where they don’t need to be informed of significant noises, they can easily stop the recording. Additionally, in the settings panel, the user also has the ability to enable and disable notifications, as well as use a light or dark theme for the website. The system is very accessible and easy to use, solely requiring a device with a microphone and a web browser, allowing it to be portable and useful in any environment.

The website enables deaf users to be alerted and informed of important noises around them, allowing them to respond appropriately and take necessary action. Further, it allows deaf people to gain independence, as in the past, they would need someone with them for situations where they would need to react to significant noises.

By converting critical sounds into accessible notifications, our website is revolutionary for bridging the gap for individuals with hearing disabilities, making everyday environments safer and more inclusive for them. Our website can be found at
